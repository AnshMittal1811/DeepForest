# What is DeepForest?

DeepForest is a python package for training and predicting individual tree crowns from RGB imagery.

## How does it work?
DeepForest uses deep learning object detection networks to predict bounding boxes corresponding to individual trees in RGB imagery. DeepForest is built on a fork of the [keras-retinanet](https://github.com/fizyr/keras-retinanet) package and designed to make training models for tree detection simpler.
